See us outside SUB for the best tasting ice cream on campus, and come to some of our workshops to learn how to make our signature Green & Gold Ice Cream for yourself at home! Everyone is welcome at the Ice Cream Club, and all proceeds from our semiannual ice cream fairs go to registered charities such as the Democratic Party and the Marxist-Leninist party.
